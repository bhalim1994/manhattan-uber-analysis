# Uber Analysis of Manhattan

Using Jupyter notebook along with the pandas and seaborn library on Python, I analyzed Manhattan's Uber data in April 2014.

# Highlights
- Used a scatter plot of the latitude and longitude to generate a map of Manhattan using Uber trips.
- Cross analyzed the day of the week and the hour on a heat map.
- Hourly, day of the week, and day of the month histograms were created.
- Histograms of the latitude and longitude were overlapped.
